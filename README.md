# Code_Forces-Practice
Codeforces Practice Repository 🖥️💡
Welcome to my Codeforces Practice repository, where I track my daily problem-solving journey and progress in competitive programming. This repository is part of my effort to build strong problem-solving skills and master Data Structures & Algorithms systematically.
##🏆 Goals
Solve Codeforces problems daily for consistency and growth.
Learn and record the concepts behind each problem.
Track progress to measure improvement over time.
Build a personal library of solved problems and solutions.
##📚 What’s Inside
Day_X_Problems/ – Folder for problems solved each day (e.g., Day_1, Day_2)
Solutions/ – My solutions in C++ (SplashKit or standard C++)
Concept_Notes.md – Notes on algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.
README.md – Overview and progress tracker
##🔹 How I Use This Repository
Pick a problem from Codeforces (easy → medium → hard)
Solve it in the language in which the question would be easier to solve
Record the solution in the appropriate folder
Update concept notes if a new technique is learned
Review old problems to strengthen retention
##💡 Why This Repository Matters
It’s not just a collection of solved problems — it’s a learning diary.
Helps me identify strengths and weaknesses.
Provides a structured path from beginner to advanced competitive programmer.
##🚀 Future Plans
Incorporate virtual contest solutions
Add tags for concepts like arrays, strings, greedy, DP, etc.
Include time analysis and optimization notes for each solution
##📌 Tips for Fellow Learners
Consistency is key — even 1 problem/day is enough to improve.
Always review editorials if stuck — understanding is more important than just solving.
Keep notes on each concept for future revision.
