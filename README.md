# Codeforces Practice Repository 🖥️💡

Welcome to my **Codeforces Practice repository**, where I track my **daily problem-solving journey** and **progress in competitive programming**.  
This repository is part of my effort to **build strong problem-solving skills** and **master Data Structures & Algorithms** systematically.

---

## 🏆 Goals
- Solve **Codeforces problems daily** for consistency and growth  
- Learn and **record the concepts** behind each problem  
- Track progress to **measure improvement** over time  
- Build a **personal library of solved problems and solutions**

---

## 📚 Repository Structure
- `Day_X_Problems/` – Problems solved each day (e.g., `Day_1`, `Day_2`)  
- `Solutions/` – My C++ solutions (SplashKit or standard C++)  
- `Concept_Notes.md` – Notes on algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques  
- `README.md` – Overview and progress tracker  

---

## 🔹 How I Use This Repository
1. Pick a **problem from Codeforces** (easy → medium → hard)  
2. Solve it in **Any language which makes the question easier**  
3. Record the solution in the appropriate folder  
4. Update **concept notes** if a new technique is learned  
5. Review old problems to **strengthen retention**

## 💡 Why This Repository Matters
- It’s not just a collection of solved problems — it’s a **learning diary**  
- Helps me identify **strengths and weaknesses**  
- Provides a structured path from **beginner to advanced competitive programmer**

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Incorporate **virtual contest solutions**  
- Add **tags for concepts** like arrays, strings, greedy, DP, etc.  
- Include **time analysis and
